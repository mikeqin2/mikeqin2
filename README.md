### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mike Qin. I am a MS student in Computer Science at UIUC. 

A majority of my work is currently being done in a private repo at a library for task and motion planning, PPL. An open-source version of the library can be found [here](https://gitlab.engr.illinois.edu/parasol-group/parasol/open-ppl).

Some of my past work can be found at [CyberGIS Center](https://github.com/cybergis) where I work as a student intern on geospatial data science.
